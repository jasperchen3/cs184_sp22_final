    <h2 align="middle"> Milestone Status Report </h2>
    <p>
      Our approach to our final project so far has been to carefully lay out our implementation approach before committing ourselves to writing code and rendering results. 
      Specifically, we’re exploring 2 approaches: an original idea that is based on our existing global illumination approach in project 3-1, and an approach laid out in 
      research papers we looked at during our project proposal. Both approaches follow the “mathematical function applied to every ray” suggestion that was given to us in 
      our project proposal feedback. More information about these approaches can be found on our google slides, which is linked <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1KoGGzOYlXbLas7l2XrCfNF7aBQHzTMYMDpwsor88J3g/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of our planning, we have read through several research papers that modeled behavior of light through media in a scene mathematically. From our planning so far, 
      we’re looking to explore the UIUC paper’s approach to path tracing in a participating medium. Thus, at this time, we have completed week 1 goals as outlined in our original 
      project proposal, but are yet to fully complete week 2’s goal of implementing working code. Hence, we updated our timeline to reflect these delays and to ensure we stay
      on track for the project presentation deadline and deliverables deadline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, in our Google Slides presentation - as linked above - we included screenshots of some pseudocode and coded ideas to our 2 approaches that we outlined above. Our
      milestone video, which is shown below, includes our explanation of the approaches we intend to pursue in the remaining part of this project.
